%description
Locomotor is an extensible path planning coordination engine that replaces
move_base. The goal is to provide a mechanism for controlling what happens when
the global and local planners succeed and fail. It leverages ROS callback queues
to coordinate multiple threads.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
